TOTALK

Writing the basic game:
    basic grid
    basic bombs in random locations:
        PLANTED some mines ( plant image )
    solution maker:
        Solution ( chemistry image )
    0 unfogger
    >0 single unfog

Optimizing:
    python slow c++ good
    numpy in c++ = numpy good
    rewrote in numpy
    tried multiprocess and failed
    was wasting too much time and wanted rough model to work

Basic Strategy:
    Q learning:
        state, action, reward
        try to calculate number of possible states and why its not feasible

    Enter Neural Networks:
        neural network doesnt have to remember all the states
        Tries to predict Q value for each action
        picks max of each action
        problem now is if max each time, the game doesn't explore random actions

        DNN: flattens
        CNN: Spatially checks vals
